## Intro to Embedded Systems - Section 1
### Lab Exercise 0: Coding Basic Math Operations in C.
The **"math.c"** file provided has 11 math operations that needs to be used with the header **"math.h"**. The basic operations included are:

1. Add (+)

2. Subtract (-)

3. Multiply (*)

4. Divide (/)

5. Modulus (%)

6. Left Shift (<)

7. Right Shift (>)

8. Bitwise AND (&)

9. Bitwise OR (|)

10. Bitwise XOR (^)

11. Bitwise Inverse (~)

The **"math.c"** file includes a math function that takes two input integers and one character sign and returns 
the answer as an output. If you wish to test the code by typing through the terminal then remove the starting and ending brackets that comments the main program function. 

 * e.g. math(35,0,'~');
 * 
 * Operation: ~
 * Inputs : 35 and 0
 * Output: -36
